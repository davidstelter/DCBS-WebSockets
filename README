DCBS-WebSockets is a pure-PHP implementation of a WebSockets server. The aim is
to provide a simple and flexible framework which allows for the creation of
WebSockets-enabled PHP applications with no need for knowledge of the WebSockets
specification, all protocol details are handled. The server forks off a new
process for each client connection, and it is capable of running multiple
applications from one control server instance.
